If you decide to update, you should update in following order:

System Update (Bring latest RaspberryOS Updates to the System)
Klipper Update ( To get latest Firmware, often flashing the MCU can wear out his memory )
Moonraker ( Having latest Version, could lead to more Features in Frontend )
Update Mainsail ( The most important! :P )
